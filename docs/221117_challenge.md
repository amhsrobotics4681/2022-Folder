Alright, you have all the tools you need to make the wheelchair bot actually useful. The code is fairly simple. Here is information to help you:

* Left motor is port 1, right motor is port 0
* Left solenoid is port 1, right solenoid is port 0
* Motors turn clockwise when given a positive value
* Buttons 5 and 6 are the L/R bumpers
* The y-axes on the Joystick are inverted

Here are general specs:
* The left joystick controls the left tread
* The right joystick controls the right tread
* Pressing a stick forward or backward causes the robot to move.
* When any stick is pressed sideways, the robot does not move.
* Buttons 5 and 6 control the left and right solenoids, respectively.
* Neither the D-Pad, nor other buttons are bound to anything.

**Happy coding, and I will see you all on December 1!**
