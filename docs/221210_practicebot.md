In the interest of time, you can pull basic code to drive the practice bot from [inside my folder](/Chris/PracticeBot/src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java) in the repository. Some values like negative signs and inversions may need to be adjusted for the robot, but this code theoretically works.

You can also find instructions for imaging the roboRIO [in the FRC documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/imaging-your-roborio.html). Connecting to the radio is potentially not possible, so if it doesn't work when you try it, just run the robot via Ethernet cable.
