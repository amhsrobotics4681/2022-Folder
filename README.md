### Season Information
**2023 Kickoff - S 1/7, 9 AM to 3 PM**  
We will meet together at AMHS and watch the game reveal together. Next, we set goals for ourselves, and design a robot according to those goals. The meeting schedule is undecided at this time, but we anticipate working T, R, S prior to finals. We may increase to working up to 6 days a week between finals and our first compeition.

As you may have seen, the 2023 WPILib VS Code was released. We will download that, the game tools, the new roboRIO image, and any other software we may need for the season. A new repository will be created as well, and with luck, we can write code into it starting the following week.

**Competition 1 - Glacier Peak, F 3/3 to U 3/5**

**Competition 2 - Bonney Lake, F 3/17 to U 3/19**
